= Puppet module: collectd

This is a puppet module for collectd based on the common credativ puppet
modules layout (https://github.com/credativ/puppet-module-template)

== Usage

Most common use case for the module is to just include it
and configure it in the hiera backend.

So including it via the following line of code or in a ENC declaration
(apart from proper configuration in hiera or top-scope variables)
is usually enough:

        class { 'collectd': }
